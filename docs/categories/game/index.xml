      <description>So, fun story, finally got this site live. Obviously it still needs a lot of love, but that will come with time. I (Ben) will be trying to post updates to our projects in a timely manner. As of this writing, we are currently on version 0.5 of Canyon Cruiser. There are a few other game ideas in the braining phase, but nothing is sure yet. After Canyon Cruiser is finished, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to pop back into the PC gaming world and work on a PvP FPS game utlizing Unity.</description>
