So, tried to use Hugo since it was a another static site generator and seemed like it should work. I honestly enjoyed using it a bit more. Well, apparently GitHub disagreed and so I was more or less forced back to using Jekyll. Oh wellz.

In other news, work on Canyon Cruiser progresses, getting the settings menu for it setup right now. Had to add some assets and whatnot. Also getting sounds implemented at the same time since that is pretty much all the settings menu works with.

Until next time!
