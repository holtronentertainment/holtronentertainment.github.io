I (Ben) will be trying to post updates to our projects in a timely manner. As of this writing, we are currently on version 0.5 of Canyon Cruiser. There are a few other game ideas in the braining phase, but nothing is sure yet. After Canyon Cruiser is finished, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to pop back into the PC gaming world and work on a PvP FPS game utlizing Unity. Not much else to report at this time.\n",
