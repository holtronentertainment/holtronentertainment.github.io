So, fun story, finally got this site live. Obviously it still needs a lot of love, but that will come with time. I (Ben) will be trying to post updates to our projects in a timely manner. 
As of this writing, we are currently on version 0.5 of Canyon Cruiser. There are a few other game ideas in the braining phase, but nothing is sure yet. After Canyon Cruiser is finished, I'm hoping to 
pop back into the PC gaming world and work on a PvP FPS game utlizing Unity. Not much else to report at this time.
